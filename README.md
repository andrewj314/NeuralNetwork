# NeuralNetwork

Simple neural network written in C++. You can add and remove layers each with an arbitrary number of nodes. Right now everything compiles, so the next step is to find an appropriate training dataset. To start, I will backtest it on historical equity data using stock fundamentals as inputs and buy/sell recommendations given a one-week horizon as outputs.

Special thanks to Andrew Hard at CERN for getting me started!
